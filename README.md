# The-Coding-Quiz

## About The Application

This is an application that will let you test your knowledge on coding! A timed quiz with multiple choice answers and a leaderboard! Once you click the 'Start Quiz' button, a timer will start, from there you'll be tasked with answering 5 multiple choice questions about JavaScript! If you click a wrong answer, it will subtract 10 seconds from the timer. Once you're finished, there will be a box to insert your initials into and it will log your initials with your final score (whatever the timer ends at) into the local storage!

There is also a separate page that will display your scores! (currently this aspect is broken unfortunately) there will also be 2 buttons, one that will return you to the start of the quiz and one that will clear your scores inside of the local storage!

## Issues

While creating this code, I ran into a few issue along the way, most were solved in the end though!

* I couldn't get the timer to stop after answering the 5th and final question. (SOLVED!)

* I also couldn't get the timer to subtract the 10 seconds after clicking a wrong answer. (SOLVED!)

* I was able to get the scores to set inside of the local storage, but I was not able to get the scores to append onto the High Scores page

* A very minor issue was that I couldn't get the underline to disappear under 'View High Scores' even when trying 'text-decoration: none" in the end I decided to just keep it, while making the underline color match the text color.

## Screenshots

Below I will include screenshots showing off the application, such as the questions and proving that the scores do set in local storage!

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I did enjoy putting this application together and I feel I had an easier time with this one than the last. I really wish I could have cracked the code (pun intended) on all of the issues listed above!
